# Redesign Project for CVILLE-Weekly

In a team of four, we worked to redesign the CVILLE-Weekly news [website](http://www.c-ville.com/). CVILLE-Weekly is an alternative weekly news publication. As a weekly, can take a more in-depth look at issues than the daily paper or TV, while using a more irreverent voice. The redesign process included a design process that allowed us to understand the users and the client. This project was to help teach us how to build a custom Wordpress theme.

## View it Live

Because this theme was build to support a news website, without a Wordpress account that contains active posts, it won't look great. You can view a live version of this project [here](http://wireframewebsites.com/cville-weekly/).
